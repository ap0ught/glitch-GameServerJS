# Glitch Game Server JavaScript Repository

> **The complete server-side codebase for Glitch, the beloved MMO that ran from 2009-2012**

This repository contains the entire server-side JavaScript codebase that powered [Glitch](http://glitchthegame.com), one of the most unique and creative MMOs ever created. Developed by Tiny Speck (who later went on to create Slack), Glitch was a browser-based multiplayer game featuring a whimsical world where players could explore, craft, socialize, and complete quests.

## üåü What Makes This Special

This isn't just any game server - it's a **complete MMO implementation** written entirely in JavaScript running on Rhino. The codebase represents years of production experience serving thousands of concurrent players and demonstrates how to build a scalable, real-time multiplayer game.

### Key Statistics & Their Significance:
- **677,660+ lines of game logic** across 1,288+ item definitions - *Demonstrates how to create rich, interactive objects that form the backbone of gameplay*
- **665 achievements** with complex progression systems - *Shows how to design and implement player retention through meaningful progression tracking*
- **448 quests** with rich narrative content - *Illustrates how to script branching narratives and manage complex story state*
- **Complete avatar customization** system with clothing, faces, and physics - *Provides a reference for character personalization systems that affect gameplay*
- **Massive world geography** with interactive locations and street spirits - *Demonstrates spatial world design with location-specific behaviors*
- **Complex economic systems** including imagination (currency), trading, and crafting - *Shows how to implement virtual economies with supply/demand mechanics*
- **Social features** including groups, parties, and local chat - *Illustrates community building systems essential for MMO retention*
- **Administrative tools** for managing a live MMO - *Provides real-world examples of operational tools needed for production games*

### Client-Server Architecture Integration

This server was designed to work seamlessly with the [Glitch Flash Client](https://github.com/ap0ught/glitch-client), demonstrating a complete client-server MMO architecture:

- **Message-based communication** between ActionScript 3 client and JavaScript server
- **Real-time synchronization** of player states, world changes, and social interactions  
- **Asset management** coordination between client rendering and server game state
- **Security model** with server-side validation of all player actions
- **Scalable design** supporting thousands of concurrent connections

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The server is built around a **message-driven architecture** where all player actions are processed through `main.js`. This design was crucial for handling the real-time demands of an MMO while maintaining game state consistency.

### Core Architecture Components:

- **Message Processing**: All client interactions handled via `processMessage()` - *enables real-time communication with Flash client*
- **Item System**: 1,288+ interactive items with custom behaviors and verbs - *provides the foundation for rich gameplay interactions*
- **Achievement Engine**: Complex progression tracking with 665 unique achievements - *drives long-term player engagement and retention*
- **Quest System**: Story-driven content with 448+ quest implementations - *delivers narrative experiences that guide player progression*
- **Physics Engine**: Custom movement and world interaction systems - *enables spatial gameplay and collision detection*
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configs (dev/prod/test) - *supports scalable deployment across different environments*

### Why This Architecture Matters:

This design demonstrates several key principles essential for MMO development:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each system is modular and can be modified independently
2. **Scalability**: Message-driven processing allows for horizontal scaling
3. **Maintainability**: Clear interfaces between systems make debugging and updates manageable
4. **Security**: Server-side validation prevents client-side exploits
5. **Flexibility**: New content can be added without core system changes

## üéÆ Key Game Systems

### Item System (1,288+ Items)
Every item in Glitch has rich behaviors defined in JavaScript, demonstrating how to create interactive game objects that feel alive and responsive:

- **Food items** with nutritional properties and cooking mechanics - *Shows how to implement complex crafting systems with meaningful choices*
- **Tools** with durability, efficiency ratings, and special abilities - *Demonstrates equipment progression and resource management*
- **Furniture** for home customization with placement rules - *Provides examples of spatial interaction and personalization systems*
- **Collectibles** including artifacts, trophies, and rare items - *Illustrates how to create collection-driven gameplay loops*
- **Interactive objects** like teleporters, machines, and magical items - *Shows how to implement special mechanics that expand gameplay possibilities*

**Why This Matters**: The item system demonstrates how to create game objects that are more than just data - they're interactive entities that respond to player actions, have persistent state, and drive meaningful player decisions.

### Achievement System (665 Achievements)
Complex progression tracking across multiple categories, showing how to maintain long-term player engagement:

- **Skill-based achievements** for cooking, mining, farming, etc. - *Encourages players to master different game systems*
- **Collection achievements** for finding rare items and artifacts - *Drives exploration and completionist gameplay*
- **Social achievements** for group activities and interactions - *Promotes community building and multiplayer engagement*
- **Exploration achievements** for discovering locations and secrets - *Rewards curiosity and world exploration*
- **Meta achievements** for completionist gameplay - *Provides long-term goals for dedicated players*

**Why This Matters**: This achievement system demonstrates how to create a progression framework that works across all game systems, providing motivation and guidance for players while tracking meaningful metrics for game developers.

### Quest System (448+ Quests)  
Rich narrative content that demonstrates how to implement story-driven gameplay in an MMO environment:

- **Story quests** that advance the main narrative - *Shows how to deliver cohesive storytelling in a persistent world*
- **Side quests** with unique characters and rewards - *Demonstrates how to create memorable moments and world-building*
- **Repeatable tasks** for ongoing gameplay - *Provides sustainable content for daily engagement*
- **Seasonal events** and limited-time content - *Shows how to maintain freshness and create urgency*
- **Tutorial quests** for new player onboarding - *Illustrates effective player education and guidance systems*

**Why This Matters**: The quest system shows how to balance narrative delivery with gameplay mechanics, creating stories that feel integrated into the world rather than separate from it.

### Avatar & Customization
